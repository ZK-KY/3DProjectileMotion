# 3DProjectileMotion
This project simulates 3D projectile motion by factoring in air resistance. The simulator uses Tkinter for the GUI and Matplotlib for visualisation, allowing users to input various parameters and observe realistic projectile trajectories. The project demonstrates the significant impact of air resistance on range and trajectory shape.
